## üó∫Ô∏è Snavio Messaging Platform ‚Äî Development Roadmap

### üî∞ Phase 0: Bootstrapping & Foundations (Week 1)

**Goals:** Prove concept viability, unblock R&D teams, ship something usable.

| CLI                     | Add `register-route` + `register-acl` commands          | Core  | Output dry-run + validation report |
| Observability           | Emit metrics for valid/invalid/denied commands          | Core  | CloudWatch counters only           |

### üîê Phase 2: Security & Replay Protection (Week 3)

**Goals:** Lock down identity, prevent replay, enforce ACLs rigorously.

| Component              | Tasks                                         | Owner  | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| IAM Policy Enforcement | Require `events:source == service tag`        | SecOps | Enforced at producer level        |
| HMAC Verification      | Add versioning, load keys from SSM            | Core   | Support for v1 + v2 grace periods |
| Replay Window          | Reject commands outside ¬±60s timestamp window | Core   | Configurable per environment      |
| Failure Events         | Emit `snavio.command.failed` and `invalid`    | Core   | Include backoff hints             |

### üß† Phase 3: Caching + Cold Start Optimization (Week 4‚Äì5)

**Goals:** Improve warm path latency, support cache TTL enforcement and partial refreshes.

| Component                   | Tasks                                                 | Owner | Notes                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |

| Post-Dispatch Check | Background DDB write after command send | Core  | Add to denylist if over-limit |
| Denylist Handling   | In-memory list with periodic TTL        | Core  | Shared via DDB on cold start  |
| Metrics             | Emit rate-limit events and counts       | Core  | `SnavioRateLimit.*` metrics   |

### üî¨ Phase 5: Monitoring & Alerting (Week 6+)

**Goals:** Ensure visibility, safety, and fast feedback during incidents.
